# RStudio Instructor Certification

This is the github repository for my RStudio instructor certification checkout. It contains


- The [lesson](https://dvanic.github.io/rstudiodemo/Lesson.html) itself
- Some [learner personas](https://dvanic.github.io/rstudiodemo/Personas.html) for who I'm imagining is attending
- A [concept map](https://dvanic.github.io/rstudiodemo/ConceptMap.html) of the mental model I'd like learners to walk away with
- A [code of conduct](https://dvanic.github.io/rstudiodemo/CoC.html), which is what I always start all of my training with, to ensure everyone feels safe and able to learn
