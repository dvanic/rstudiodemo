Below is a concept map of the overall content of this lesson. 

I have fleshed out the concepts relating to the:

- `filter()` - green
- `%>%` - purple
- `arrange()` - cyan

Portions of the lesson, although I expect that in 15 minutes we would work through the filtering (green) and - possibly but highly unlikely - the pipe (purple) component.  I haven't fleshed out the `select()` section at this point, as whether to introduce things like `starts_with()` here or in another section needs to be taken in the context of the entire training plan.

Ideally, I'd hope my learners would add the ideas shown in red to their global mental model of the tidyverse and tidy data/data wrangling in R.
