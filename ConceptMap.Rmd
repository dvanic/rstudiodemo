title: 'Concept map'

For the filtering section, which is what I would expect to get through in 15 minutes, a canonical concept map looks something like this:

The sketchnote/bigger picture I hope learners walk away from in this lesson is below. 

I have fleshed out the 

- `filter()` - green
- `%>%` - purple
- `arrange()` - cyan

Portions of the lesson.  I haven't fleshed out the `select()` section at this point, as whether to introduce things like `starts_with()` here or in another section needs to be taken in the context of the entire training plan.

Ideally, I'd hope my learners would add the ideas shown in red to their global mental model (already existing things shown in black) of the tidyverse and tidy data/data wrangling in R.
